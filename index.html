                        this site is created purely in html and has none of the special features you'll find on almost any professionally designed website today.
                        the idea behind coding a website like this is that it reveals the inherent aesthetic properties of html itself, much like brutalist architecture celebrates
                        raw materials. a major proponent of this web design philosophy today is the net art pioneer Olia Lialina, whose work you can find in the Arena channel.

                        one activity we'll get to do is link everyone's websites together in a web ring. the main idea here is that there will be one hyperlink on every website which will
                        eventually loop around in a circle, forming a closed ecosystem of websites made in this class.

                        everyone's websites will also contain a section beneath their intro where their works will be located. this part might be a bit ahistorical, as it could involve some javascript
                        or html5 elements. I remember when html5 got released in the very early 2010s. I wonder if anyone has kept all the flash files that used to populate the web beforehand.
